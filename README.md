# Software-Defined-System
The solution uses Software-Defined Systems (SDS), AI, and IoT to build advanced early warning systems for urban areas. Software-Defined Devices (SDDs) monitor environmental parameters and AI algorithms predict hazards, allowing for preemptive risk mitigation and improving urban safety and resilience.
