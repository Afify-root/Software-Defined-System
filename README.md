It supports multi-factor authentication and integrates with social identity providers like Facebook and Google, providing a seamless user experience.
•	User Management: Cognito manages user profiles, preferences, and other attributes, allowing us to deliver personalized experiences to our users.

2. Amazon API Gateway
•	API Management: Amazon API Gateway allows us to create, publish, maintain, and secure RESTful APIs at any scale. It acts as a "front door" for our application, handling all the requests from mobile clients and routing them to the appropriate backend services.
•	Integration with AWS Services: API Gateway integrates seamlessly with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and other AWS services, enabling efficient communication between different components of our architecture.

3. AWS Lambda
•	Serverless Computing: AWS Lambda enables us to run code without provisioning or managing servers. We use Lambda functions to execute backend logic in response to API Gateway requests, DynamoDB streams, and other events.
•	Scalability and Cost Efficiency: Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests, ensuring high availability and performance. It operates on a pay-per-use model, making it a cost-effective solution for our application.

4. Amazon DynamoDB
•	NoSQL Database: Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It stores and retrieves large volumes of structured data for our application, ensuring low-latency responses.
•	High Availability and Durability: DynamoDB offers built-in high availability and durability, with automatic data replication across multiple Availability Zones within the North Virginia region.

5. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
•	Object Storage: Amazon S3 provides scalable object storage for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time. We use S3 buckets to store application assets, user-generated content, and backup data.
•	Data Security and Durability: S3 ensures data security with features like encryption and access control policies. It also offers high durability by automatically replicating data across multiple facilities.

6. AWS CloudWatch
•	Monitoring and Logging: AWS CloudWatch collects and tracks metrics, monitors log files, and sets alarms. It provides insights into our application's performance and operational health, allowing us to identify and address issues promptly.
•	Event Management: CloudWatch enables us to automate responses to operational changes by triggering actions based on predefined rules, such as scaling resources or sending notifications.
